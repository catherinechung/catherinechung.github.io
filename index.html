								<h2>Square Code Camp<h2>
								<h3>August 15 - 20 2016, New York City</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>I was accepted as one of 17 females to Square's prestigious bootcamp to code,
										gain career insight, and develop leadership skills. Being part of such a small program,
									  I was privileged to become close friends with each girl in the program.</li>
									<li>We spent our
										days touring Square's New York office, listening to tech talks, and learning about Ruby
										on Rails and web dev. </li>
									<li> My favorite experience was getting having lunch with a "mentor",
										  who is one of Square's engineers. One of my daily thoughts is how to get a summer
											internship and I stress over that pretty often. He assured me that there's no point
											in living life with pressure like that. Do what you enjoy, and your life will be satisfactory.</li>
									<li>The main part of the program was working on a Passion Project, which was revamping the Global
											 Women's Institute website. Their mission was to advocate and inform people about women violence
											  and inequality, and we were able to use the Ruby on Rails knowledge that we had just learned to
												 host our idea of a new website. </li>

								<h2>Qualcomm Women's Collegiate Conference<h2>
								<h3>January 2016</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>In January 2016, I was invited to a conference hosted by Qualcomm with a goal to connect women in computing and introduce them to new opportunities. </li>
									<li>At the conference, it was a mix of technical workshops, leadership talks, networking, and mock interviews.</li>
									<li>My favorite part of the program was the hackathon where we worked with middle school girls from the San Diego area to hack for "good". While it was my first time working with Arduinos, the middle school girls were already very familiar with them!</li>
									<li>It was a great experience meeting a community of females in tech and learning more about computer hardware and engineering, a career path I had never considered until this program.</li>
									<li>I am still very close with some of the girls in the program, and can't wait to work with them in industry one day!</li>
